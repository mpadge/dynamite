\details{
Currently the \code{dynamite} package supports the following
distributions for the observations:
\itemize{
\item Categorical: \code{categorical} (with a softmax link using the first category
as reference). See the documentation of the \code{categorical_logit_glm} in the
Stan function reference manual (https://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/).
\item Gaussian: \code{gaussian} (identity link, parameterized using mean and standard
deviation).
\item Poisson: \code{poisson} (log-link, with an optional known offset variable).
\item Negative-binomial: \code{negbin} (log-link, using mean and dispersion
parameterization, with an optional known offset variable). See the
documentation on \code{NegBinomial2} in the Stan function reference manual.
\item Bernoulli: \code{bernoulli} (logit-link).
\item Binomial: \code{binomial} (logit-link).
\item Exponential: \code{exponential} (log-link).
\item Gamma: \code{gamma} (log-link, using mean and shape parameterization).
\item Beta: \code{beta} (logit-link, using mean and precision parameterization).
}

The models in the \pkg{dynamite} package are defined by combining the
channel-specific formulas defined via  \R formula syntax.
Each channel is defined via the \code{obs} function, and the channels are
combined with \code{+}. For example a formula
\code{obs(y ~ lag(x), family = "gaussian") + obs(x ~ z, family = "poisson")}
defines a model with two channels;
first we declare that \code{y} is a gaussian variable depending on a previous
value of \code{x} (\code{lag(x)}), and then we add a second channel declaring \code{x} as
Poisson distributed depending on some exogenous variable \code{z}
(for which we do not define any distribution).

In addition to declaring response variables via \code{obs}, we can also use
the function \code{aux} to define auxiliary channels which are deterministic
functions of other variables. The values of auxiliary variables are computed
dynamically during prediction, making the use of lagged values and other
transformations possible. Note that the auxiliary channel can also depend
on other variables without lags. The function \code{aux} also does not use the
\code{family} argument, which is automatically set to \code{deterministic} and is a
special channel type of \code{obs}. Note that lagged values of deterministic
\code{aux} channels do not imply fixed time points. Instead they must be given
starting values using a special function \code{past()}, which defines the
starting values of the channel and its lags. However, starting values are
needed only when the values of the auxiliary channel cannot be computed
based on its definition.

The formula within \code{obs} can also contain an additional special
function \code{varying}, which defines the time-varying part of the model
equation, in which case we could write for example
\code{obs(x ~ z + varying(~ -1 + w), family = "poisson")}, which defines a model
equation with a constant intercept and time-invariant effect of \code{z}, and a
time-varying effect of \code{w}. We also remove the duplicate intercept with \code{-1}
in order to avoid identifiability issues in the model estimation
(we could also define a time varying intercept, in which case we would write
\verb{obs(x ~ -1 + z + varying(~ w), family = "poisson)}). The part of the formula
not wrapped with \code{varying} is assumed to correspond to the fixed part of the
model, so \code{obs(x ~ z + varying(~ -1 + w), family = "poisson")} is actually
identical to
\code{obs(x ~ -1 + fixed(~ z) + varying(~ -1 + w), family = "poisson")} and
\code{obs(x ~ fixed(~ z) + varying(~ -1 + w), family = "poisson")}.

When defining varying effects, we also need to define how the these
time-varying regression coefficient behave. For this, a \code{splines} component
should be added to the model, e.g.,
\verb{obs(x ~ varying(~ -1 + w), family = "poisson) + splines(df = 10)} defines a
cubic B-spline with 10 degrees of freedom for the time-varying coefficient
corresponding to the \code{w}. If the model contains multiple time-varying
coefficients, same spline basis is used for all coefficients, with unique
spline coefficients and their standard deviation.

It is also possible to define a random intercept term for each group by
using component \code{random} where the first argument defines for which channels
the intercept should be added, and second argument defines whether or not
these intercepts should be correlated between channels. This leads to a
model where the in addition to the common intercept each individual/group
has their own intercept with zero-mean normal prior and unknown standard
deviation (or multivariate gaussian in case \code{correlated = TRUE}),
analogously with the typical mixed models. Note however that if the channel
already contains the lagged response variable, the "intercept" is actually a
slope of (linear) trend as dynamite does not do any centering of variables.
With a large number of time points these intercepts can become challenging
sample with default priors. This is because with large group sizes the
group-level intercepts tend to be behave similarly to fixed group-factor
variable so the model becomes overparameterized given these and the common
intercept term. In these cases, a better option might be to use fixed group
effects, i.e. to include the grouping variable to the model instead of
random intercept (this way the one group is included in the intercept).
