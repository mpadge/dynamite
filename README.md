The `dynamite` package provides easy-to-use interface for Bayesian
inference of complex panel data. The main features distinguishing the
package and the underlying methodology from many other approaches are

-   Support for both time-varying and time-invariant effects
-   Joint modelling of multiple measurements per individual (multiple
    channels)
-   Support for non-gaussian observations
-   Realistic counterfactual predictions which take account the dynamic
    structure of the model
-   Clear quantification of parameter and predictive uncertainty due to
    Bayesian approach
-   User-friendly and efficient R interface with state-of-the-art
    estimation via Stan.

The `dynamite` package is developed with the support of Academy of
Finland grant 331817.
